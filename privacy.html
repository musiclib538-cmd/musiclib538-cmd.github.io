        <p class="mb-6">This privacy policy applies to the MusicLib app (hereby referred to as "Application") created by Aaditya Rushabh Shah (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The Application collects information to provide and improve the service. This include:</p>

        <h2>Data Security and Protection</h2>
        <p>The Service Provider utilizes Firebase's secure Firestore database and Cloud Functions to protect your subscription status. We implement strict security rules to ensure that your "isPremium" status can only be modified by our secure backend systems and not by the Application itself.</p>

        <h2>Account and Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>Users have the right to request the deletion of their account and all associated personal data. If you would like to delete your account, please contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:musiclib538@gmail.com" class="text-purple-400 font-bold">musiclib538@gmail.com</a>. Profile information will be removed from our servers within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Application does not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13. If a child under 13 has provided personal information, it will be immediately deleted upon discovery.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the Service and to comply with legal obligations. Retention periods vary by data type (e.g., subscription records are retained for billing and fraud prevention; usage logs are retained for analytics and debugging for a limited period).</p>

        <h2>Data Access & Your Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are entitled to data-protection rights under applicable law (for example under the GDPR), you may request access to, correction, deletion of, or portability of your personal data, or request restriction of processing. To exercise these rights, contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:musiclib538@gmail.com" class="text-purple-400 font-bold">musiclib538@gmail.com</a> and include your Google account email and UID. We will respond to valid requests without undue delay and, where required by law, within 30 days.</p>

        <h2>Cookies & Analytics</h2>
        <p>The Application and our third-party providers use cookies and analytics tools to understand usage and improve the Service. You can control certain tracking and advertising settings via your device or by adjusting Google/AdMob preferences. For details on third-party analytics, see the provider privacy links above.</p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States. When transfers occur, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as the third-party provider's privacy and security measures. By using the Application you consent to such transfers.</p>

        <h2>Lawful Basis (EU Users)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area, the lawful bases for processing your personal data are: your consent (where requested), performance of a contract, and our legitimate interests in operating and improving the Service.</p>
